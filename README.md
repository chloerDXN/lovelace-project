# Title 
Who are the carnivors?

# Abstract
With increasingly dire climate change forecasts, concerned individuals are asking how they can minimize their carbon footprint. Recent research suggests that reducing one's consumption of meat, in particular beef, is one of the highest impact actions an individual can take. To examine this topic, we will explore the trends in meat consumption in the U.S. by analyzing the prevalence of meat in recipes frequented online. Specifically, we plan to extract the ingredients, time and location of clicks from a recipe database. Using this information, we will explore the link between meat consumption and various key factors such as time of year, rural and urban locations, average regional income or historic events (i.e. the Paris Climate Agreement, mad cow disease outbreak). Finally, we hope to directly relate this data to the issue of climate change by estimating a rating reflecting the carbon footprint of meat in recipes and the environmental impact of consumers' diets. 

# Research questions

1. How can we rate the carbon footprint of the meat in a recipe?

2. How does the meat consumption vary between different regions?

3. How does the meat consumption vary over time?

4. Example questions to characterize the carnivors further:
    a.) Is the hypothesis that rich people eat more meet valid?
    b.) Does rural or urban population eat more meat?
    c.) How does meat consumption vary with temperature and season?
    d.) Is the meat consumption affected by press on animal illnesses or environmental effects?

5. How can we conlude from our findings to do general statements?


# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

1. Data exploration:
    a.) Get the data on the computer
    b.) Figure out how to get the information from an html file in a treatable dataform
    c.) Extract the relevant information on ingredients, quantities, number of clicks, regional and time information.

2. Invent a formula to rate the environmental impact of the meat in a recipe.

3. Quantify the meat consumption regionaly and over time.

4. Characterize the meat eating population (carnivors) by anlyzing the research questions

5. Do an indept analysis of the findings, including their situational and statistical relevance.

6. Conclusion on the project

# Questions for TAa

1. In which points do you think this project is too ambitious?

2. What would be the smartest way to access the information in such a number of html files?
